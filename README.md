# 8 Week SQL Challenge

To start the postgres database with all the schemas created, run `docker-compose up -d` if you have Docker and docker-compose set up.

This will make a Postgres instance available at `0.0.0.0:5432`, with buncha migrations from [schemas](./schema/).

The solutions/walkthroughs to the challenges can be found in the individual challenge directories.
